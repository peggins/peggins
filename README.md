I'm Elm enthusiast and software developer.  
Building web applications whenever possible.  
Currently working and studying with the following tools:

- Elm
- VueJS
- Redux
- MotionUI

I recently built my first web application with Elm, Notea â€” an notepad online., which I really enjoyed working on ([read more](https://medium.com/@joao.marconl/how-i-built-an-online-notepad-with-elm-and-why-it-was-a-great-decision-f17b360805ae)).
